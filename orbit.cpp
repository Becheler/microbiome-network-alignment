/* orbit.cpp
 * A program to calculate the O vector used in the GRAAL score function.
 * The O vector has 73 coordinates, 1 for each orbit. 
 * The value at each coordinate is the number of other orbits contained within that orbit.
 * 
 * This vector varies only by the range of orbits we're concerned with, so it need only be calculated once.
